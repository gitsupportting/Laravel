				<p>In our very first section, we’ll become familiar with the concept of AI by looking into its definition and some examples.</p>
				<p>As you have probably noticed, AI is currently a “hot topic”: media coverage and public discussion about AI is almost impossible to avoid. However, you may also have noticed that AI means different things to different people. For some, AI is about artificial life-forms that can surpass human intelligence, and for others, almost any data processing technology can be called AI.</p>
				<p>To set the scene, so to speak, we’ll discuss what AI is, how it can be defined, and what other fields or technologies are closely related. Before we do so, however, we’ll highlight three applications of AI that illustrate different aspects of AI. We’ll return to each of them throughout the course to deepen our understanding</p>
				<h4>Recommendations from experts</h4>
				<p>A lot of the information that we encounter in the course of a typical day is personalized. Examples include Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other social media content; online advertisements; music recommendations on Spotify; movie recommendations on Netflix, HBO, and other streaming services. Many online publishers such as newspapers’ and broadcasting companies’ websites as well as search engines such as Google also personalize the content they offer.</p>
